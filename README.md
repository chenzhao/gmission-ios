## Where to get the latest version:

- **If you do not know how to build by yourself, you can also use TestFlight to get our latest beta version. Just send your email address to zchenah#ust.hk and install the "TestFlight" app from appstore. Then you will get an invitation email which includes an TestFlight redeem code. Input the code to get gMission beta version.**
